//comments & structure

-- COMMENTS --
-- BAD COMMENTS
- mostly we want to avoid redundand comments
- if code makes sense, don't use comments
- commented-out code: don't use them
--- GOOD COMMENTS
- legal information, disclaimer
- explanation that can't be explained by naming
- warnings
- TODO notes
- unfinished code can be commented-out
- PEP 257: function description documentation strings (""" ... """)


--STRUCTURE--

-- CODE FORMATTING 
- Vertical formatting: readable like an essay. top to bottom, without too many "jumps"
    - space between lines
    - grouping of code
    * consider splitting files with multiple concepts (eg classes)
    * different concepts should be seperated by spacing in the same file.

-Horizontal formatting: readable without scrolling
    - Indentation: intuitive
    - Space between code
    - Line width
    * use indentation even if not neccessary in order to avoid scrolling
    * avoid too long naming

- PEP8: Python style guide
